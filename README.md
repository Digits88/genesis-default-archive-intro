## Genesis Default Archive Intro

This plugin ensures an archive intro always appears on category, tag, and taxonomy term archives. It sets the Archive Headline to default to the term name, and the Archive Intro Text to default to the term description. 

You can still write your own custom headline/intro text by using the "Archive Headline" and "Archive Intro Text" fields.
